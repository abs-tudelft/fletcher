 * copy the bytes to on the device. The address of this region will be the device destination address.
 *
 * This function can be used mainly for streamable applications. When data reuse is expected, on-board memory is often
 * faster. For this purpose, platformCacheHostBuffer can be used.

 * @param alloced               Whether the buffer caused a new allocation on the device, that should be freed after
 *                              usage (0 = not alloced, 1 = alloced).
